# Call Center - Notes

When first going through the problem, I created a respondent class thinking that would be a good way to be able to store an employee's name and status in one place. However, as I built out the CallCenter class, I realized I could also store status by having two separate queues - one of available employees, and one of busy employees - that would keep track of their statuses.

In the problem, it is unclear what happens once an employee is on a call that can not be handled. The way I've written it assumes that once a call is unsolveable, the employee assigned to that call remains unvailable permanently. If there was perhaps a way to incorporate call length as a variable, that could be a way to move employees out of the busy queue back into the avialable queue.

If there are ever available respondents they will always get the solveable calls, they can only move to busy queue once the director and manager busy queues are full.
